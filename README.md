## Getting Started

If you're new to the world of Large Language Models, you can start by exploring the resources in the "Libraries" section to learn more about different libraries and tools available for working with LLMs.

## Libraries

### Hugging Face Transformers

[Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) is a popular library for working with transformer-based LLMs. Check out our collection of code snippets and notebooks for working with Transformers.

### LangChain

[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain/langchain) is a cutting-edge language model technology. Dive into LangChain-related code and examples here.

### LlamaIndex

[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/llamaindex/llamaindex) is a unique resource for LLM enthusiasts. Explore our repository for projects and best practices related to LlamaIndex.

### OpenAI API

[OpenAI API](https://github.com/openai/openai-api) powers some of the most advanced language models. Discover how to harness the power of OpenAI's models in our OpenAI API section.

## Projects

In the "Projects" section, you'll find open-source projects and applications built using LLMs. These projects demonstrate the practical applications of LLM technology.

- [Project 1](link-to-project1) - A brief description of the project.
- [Project 2](link-to-project2) - Another exciting project using LLMs.
